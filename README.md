ROADMAP
- add file format check
- server side benchmark
- clean server side file storage periodically
- server side error handler
- make server side logic clearer
- make compress images an API service
- server log
- frontend shows more info (uploading, processing, etc.)
- ? probably frequent and too large file request block
- ? probably rewrite frontend code using React
